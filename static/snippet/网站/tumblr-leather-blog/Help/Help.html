                        <p>In your pack you will find the following PSD files:</p>
                        <ol>
                        <li>leather-style-blog.psd - The design</li>
                        	</ol>
                        <p>Editing these files is simple enough for anyone with even a basic grasp of Photoshop. Only simple effects were used in this design so I feel there is little point in explaining each and every layer of the PSD's here; if you are new to Photoshop I would recommend you visit <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/08/12/12-beginner-tutorials-for-getting-started-with-photoshop/">this website</a>.</p><p>Editing the text:<br>Once you have downloaded and installed the fonts detailed in the <a href="#article2">Sources section</a> you're ready to edit.<br>Either click the 'T' in your layers palette or choose the 'Type Tool' from the Photoshop 'Tools' and type the text you desire. Text which uses effects can be edited thus - double click where it says 'fx' and you can edit the special effects which are in use on that layer (such as Drop Shadow, Color Overlay, etc).</p>
<p>Editing the images:<br>
<img class="bigimg" src="assets/preview-the-psd.jpg" alt="">
<span class="notice">Patterns are used widely in this design!</span> Please refer to the above image for details; I used only the black version of the 'Free Tileable Leather Patterns' (as detailed in the <a href="#article2">sources</a> section). If you've never used Patterns in Photoshop before I recommend you read <a href="http://melsbrushes.wordpress.com/2008/02/08/how-to-use-patterns-photoshop-beginners/">this article</a>.</p>
<h3>Let me explain the rest of the PSD:</h3>
<figure><img src="assets/typical.jpg" height="389" alt=""></figure>
<p>As complicated as it may first seem this is in fact a relatively simple theme that uses the same effects for each section so I'll detail the 'Posts' section here:
<br>Open the 'Posts' folder, now open the 'Quote' folder and it looks like the preview to the right.</p>
<p>Running down the list, our first layer is 'quote by' which is a simple text layer with no effects as is the second layer 'it is better...'. The 'icon' layer denotes the icon to the left of the post type; in this case it's a quote so it uses the quote icon with some drop shadow. The drop shadow also appears on the stitches layer.<br>
Next we have a sub-folder called 'Like and Reblog btns' which is copied all the way through all of the post types in this PSD. This folder contains the original Tumblr icons for reblog and like plus some simple text so you should have no need to edit these.<br>
Our last sub-folder is called 'bg stitches' and contains some images of stitches which group together to become the frame around the 'bg' (background) for that post.
You can edit the size of the stitches by using the 'Stitched fabric accordion PSD' as detailed in the <a href="#article2">sources</a> section.</p>
<p>You will quickly realise that I duplicated fx throughout the theme - most text has the same fx, most images have the same fx; I did this so that if you decide to code the theme it will make your life easier.</p>

                        For this to become a true 'live' Tumblr blog you'd need to have it coded (see 'More Help').</p>
